ChargeIT is an iOS application built using UIKit that demonstrates the core experience of an electric vehicle charging app. The project includes a complete flow starting from user authentication, adding vehicles, setting up payment methods, and viewing charging stations on a map. All screens are designed in Storyboard, and navigation is handled entirely through segues without using programmatic code.

This project helped me practice:

Building UI using UIKit and Auto Layout

Working with Navigation Controller and Tab Bar Controller

Designing multi-step user flows in Storyboard

Creating clean, structured screens for forms, maps, and filters

The goal of ChargeIT is to showcase how a real EV charging app could be structured visually and navigationally using UIKit.
